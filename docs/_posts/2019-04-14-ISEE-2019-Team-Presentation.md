> *"Money, like emotions, is something you must control to keep your life on the right track"
  -Natasha Munson*


## Project Motivation:

During the initial months of us coming to a foreign land for studies, we realized only too late that money can seep through your hands like sand through a closed fist if you do not keep a track on it. Through this project we shall try our level best to tailor make an app which is easy to use and would require just one look to keep a track and plan a budget according to the needs and expenses of an individual.

As, for our app name, we being 90's kids, this is a pun on our beloved anime *"Pokemon"* as well as a ledger to check where did our user actually *"Spend Them On?"*

## Our Team:

Our team consists of a mix bag of an Electrical, Mechanical and an Electronics Engineer, who have now dived headfirst into the sea of Computer Science and are  really excited to develop an app and show it off to their friends and peers back home. Without further ado, here we introduce our team members:

1. **Atrayee Neog :** A struggling Electronic Engineer who found passion and comfort behind the programming logics and algorithms of Computer Science. My motivation behind doing this project is to testify my theoretical knowledge into an implementation in real life and to channelize my ideas into building something worthwhile.

  ** Roles: **

2. **SeyedBehnam Beladi :** 

3. **Pavan Kumar Kandapagari :** A guy with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a soft spot for technology. My motivation behind this project is to produce an usable product along with testing the skills I have learnt in the previous semester.
