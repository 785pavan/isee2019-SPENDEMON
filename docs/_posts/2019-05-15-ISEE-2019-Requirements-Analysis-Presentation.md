Welcome to the second stage of our development for the app SPENDEMON. In this particular blog, we intend to present the requirements which our customer wanted implemented in our app and how we analysed the requirements into tangible formats so as to implement it in our App. 

**<span style="color:#C2185B; font-family:Cursive">Overview:</span>**
The main stages for the Requirement Analysis includes:
1. Drafting the initial Requirements questionnaire.
2. Gathering the requirements from the customer.
3. Analysing the requirements and mapping them into Use-Case diagrams and Class diagrams.
4. Mapping the user stories to Behavioural diagrams to be implemented in Java.

The initial meeting for our requirement analysis took place on the "" where we decided on the questions and requirements that we want to suggest to the customer for the next meeting. A snapshot of the questionnaire has been given below:


Based on the first meeting with our customer, we could now finalise on our User stories alongwith our Use-Case diagrams and the overall Class diagrams for different Activities to be implemented in the App.
