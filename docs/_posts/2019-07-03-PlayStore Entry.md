Welcome to the last Blog for team SPENDEMON. We cannot express our gratitude enough to the ones who have stuck with us since the beginning till now. We hope we were able to create something useful and easy for you and reading our Blogs inspired you too to start an App of your own.
<p>

</p>
For one last time we are here to deliver to you the final finished product of the three months of our journey so far. Here we shall talk about the App, its features, and why we think that this is a good App for you to have in your life.

<h2> <b><span style="color:#008183 ">SPENDEMON:</span></b></h2>
<div style = "text-align:justify">The App SPENDEMON is your personalised Pokemon which has the ability to track your expenses and give you a check every now and then regarding your indulges. There are thousands of Money managing Apps and budget control Apps in the market. So what makes this App standout? It's simplicity and ease of use we would say. In the development phase of this App, there wasn't only the three of us who were the developers, but there was a fourth developer and that was the customer himself. Hence, this App has been fine tuned to what customers generally need in such an App. It is hence, simple, efficient and to the point.

<p>
To convince you about the utility about our App, we need to highlight the features of the App as well. So let us have a look into what is in (play) store for us:
</p>
<p>
<h3>Iconified Summary:</h3> The Summary Page is not only a summary for what transactions you have made but also it is filled with icons which help to view the category, type, payment method etc. with simply one glance. Besides this, there is an option to edit your entries by clicking on them and adding on to the pop up that appears.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Filtering:</h3> Suppose you have a lot of transactions in your Summary and need to filter out the ones based on a particular month or category. Fear not, because we have the categorical filtering options for you as well. The App has the options to filter data from the database based on the various categories, types of transactions, payment methods as well as based on the any range of dates given by the user. Apart from that, there is no real pressure to fill in every single field for filtering, as the App automatically takes all the details into account once a filter is left unchecked.
