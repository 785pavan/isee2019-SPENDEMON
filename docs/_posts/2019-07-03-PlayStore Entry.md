Welcome to the last Blog for team SPENDEMON. We cannot express our gratitude enough to ones who have stuck with us since the beginning. We hope we have been able to create something useful and simple for your daily use. We also hope that reading our Blogs inspires you too to start building an App of your own.
<p>

</p>
For one last time we are here delivering to you our final product. It has been developed over a course of three months and it felt like journey for us. Here we are going to talk about the features that our App brings and why you would need such a good App in your daily life.

<h2> <b><span style="color:#008183 ">About the App:</span></b></h2>
<div style = "text-align:justify">The App SPENDEMON is your personalized Pokemon which has the ability to track your expenses, incomes and it will give you a check every now and then regarding your indulges. There are hundreds of Money managing and budget control Apps in the market. So what makes this App standout? Well, It's simplicity and ease of use we would say. In the development phase of this App, it was three of us who developed the app but that was not all, there were more and we are talking about our customers who helped us find out more about our shortcomings and where we can improve. Therefore, this App has been fine tuned to what customers generally need in such an App. It is hence, simple, efficient and to the point.
<p>

</p>
<h2> <b><span style="color:#008183 ">Features:</span></b></h2>

<p>
To convince you about the utility of our App, we need to highlight the features of the App as well. So let us have a look into what is in (play) store for us:
</p>
<p>
<h3>Iconified Summary:</h3> The Summary Page is not only a summary for what transactions you have made but also it is filled with icons which help to view the category, type, payment method etc. with a simple glance. Beside this, there is an option to edit your entries by clicking on them and adding on to the pop up that appears.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Filtering:</h3> Suppose you have a lot of transactions in your Summary and need to filter out the ones based on a particular month or category. Fear not, because we have the categorical filtering options for you as well. The App has the option to filter your transactions from the database based on the various categories, types of transactions, payment methods as well as based on the any range of dates given by the user. Apart from that, there is no real pressure to fill in every single field for filtering, as the App automatically takes all the details into account once a filter is left unchecked.
<p>
</p>
<h3>Thresholds and Graphs:</h3> A money control App is of no use if it does not tell you where you need to control your expenses or how much you are spending on which category. For this we have Pie Charts and Trend Lines which give a clear picture on how much one has spent for each and every category. Don't forget to play with the Pie Charts too as they can be spun around and can be a distraction when you are pondering over life and how expensive it is ;).
<p>
</p>
Apart from this, we also have a threshold feature for our users who need an extra push to save. Users have the option to set a particular threshold for their expenses and a bar will display how much of the threshold you have reached.
<p>
</p>
<h3>Downloadable PDF Report:</h3> If a user wants to keep a hard copy of their incomes and expenses, we have provided an option. You can save all of your transactions as a PDF on your memory and print or share it for official or personal use.
<p>
</p>
<h3>Easy User Interface:</h3> The main USP of our App is that it is particularly easy to use and we have made sure that our users can navigate through the App in an utmost fluidic manner. Hence, not only do we have Navigation Drawers on both sides of the Summary interface but we also have options like the Swipe Delete, Delete All, Double Tap Exits to name a few which makes using our App easy breezy.
<p>
</p>
<h3>Well Tested App:</h3> For our users to have a good experience with the App, we have tested the App on various levels to avoid any bugs or crashes in unpredictable circumstances. The tests include everything from wrong passwords, to null cases, to checking whether the entries work correctly, to ensuring if the navigation is functional, we have tested every activity, every fragment of the App numerous times and so, we are confident enough to say that the user shall not find any inconvenience or any crashes while working on the App as we have taken appropriate precautions to ensure that we prevent any chances of these unseen scenario.
<p>
</p>
<h2> <b><span style="color:#008183 ">Non-Functional Requirements:</span></b></h2>
Apart from the functional requirements mentioned above, we also have some non-functional features that might be interesting to see for the User:
<ol type="1">
<li>Category of the App: Utility App which serves as a Money tracker or Budget Planner.</li>
<li>Age Limit: None. Due to the easy usability of the App, there is no age limit. (Even toddlers can play with the Pie Charts and icons!)</li>
<li>Android Version Compatibility: Built on API level 19 or version 4.4, the App is compatible upto API level 28 or version 9.0</li>
<li>Security: The App has both Authentication as well as Authorization options at the beginning and is hence completely safe.</li>
<li>Supported Devices: The App is supported in Smartphones as well as Tablets.</li>
<li>Memory Consumption: The App is efficient in memory and energy consumption and consumes around 5MB storage space and refrains from running in the background, hence saving energy.
<li>Target Group: As we have maintained before, the App is not designed for a certain target group only but can be used by anyone who is in search of controlling the flow of their money.</li>
<p>
</p>

<h2> <b><span style="color:#008183 ">Final Thoughts:</span></b></h2>
With these few images we have finally come to the end of a beautiful journey where there was everyday learning, creativity flowing, some intensive brainstorming but most of all a journey which was extremely fun to begin with. As three Engineers who for the first time embarked into the journey of App development, we are grateful for this course and the Professor for designing such a well structured course which helped us learn so much everyday.
<p>
</p>
When we set out on this journey, our sole aim was to develop a simple App which people might find useful in their everyday lives. If you, our readers, find this effort of ours worth installing then click <a href = "https://github.com/DBSE-teaching/isee2019-SPENDEMON/releases/download/V0.1.2/Spendemon.apk" target="_blank" > here. </a> and please do write to us about your experiences. With your feedback we will be able to grow this App into a popular one among the masses some day.
<p>
</p>
Lastly, a huge final Danke Schön to our readers for showing interest in our progress. Hopefully, we will meet you all in the future with something better and something much more exciting again.

Till then, Tschüss!!
