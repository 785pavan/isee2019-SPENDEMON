  <<h2> align="justify" style="font-family: verdana">Hello to all visiting this page! Along with the lecture "Introduction to Software Engineering for Enginners" at Otto-von-Guericke, Magdeburg, we, a team of three Engineers are foraging into the
    universe of Android App
    development.
    Here in this page, you can read about our struggles and progresses as we try to develop an app "SPENDEMON", a money control app, to keep track of the money you spend
    and keep a ledger for all your incomes and expenses. Thank you for showing interest in our efforts. Hope you enjoy the ride! <font size="5">Prost!!</font>
